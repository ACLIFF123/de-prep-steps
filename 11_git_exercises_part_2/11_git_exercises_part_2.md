## Commit and push

1. Using the terminal, create a new file called `git-terminology.txt` and add the snippet below to the file:

```txt
git clone <github-link-here> - makes a local copy of the remote repo at the specified link
git status - shows the state of files in our working directory and staging area
git add <file-name> - adds a file from the working directory to the staging area
git commit -m "<message-here>" - makes a commit including all changes in the staging area
```

2. Make a new commit to include this change.
3. Push this new change up to GitHub.

At this point, press refresh on the GitHub page. You should be able to see the newly added file.
