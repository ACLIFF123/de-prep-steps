# Challenge 1

##Â Instructions

It's now time to write your own `import` statements!

In the `challenges_1` directory you will find four sub-directories named sections 1-4. In each of these section directories you will find files named `destination.py`. If you run these files with `python`, you will see a `NameError` complaining that various things are not defined.

It will be your job to import the necessary variables or functions in order to satisfy the goals of the tasks listed below. You might even write a little bit of extra Python!

For these tasks, you will **not** need to change your _Python Path_.

## Tasks

1. Using the available file in `section_1`, you need to write an import statement in `destination.py` that allows the print statement to execute successfully. _Run the `destination.py` file with `python` to make sure it works._

2. Using the available nested file in `section_2`, you need to write an import statement that allows you to print the mentor's name. You should only be printing the string, not the whole dictionary! _Run the `destination.py` file with `python` to make sure it works._

3. Using the available nested files in `section_3`, you should write and import statement and then create an appropriate greeting string using the mentor's name. _Run the `destination.py` file with `python` to make sure it works._

4. Using the available files in `section_4`, you should write import statements that allow the invocation of the `sum_nums` function with the numbers in `example_numbers.py`. You should be able the print the result. _Run the `destination.py` file with `python` to make sure it works._
