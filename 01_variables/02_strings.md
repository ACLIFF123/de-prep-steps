# Strings

In the Python REPL, create the following string variables:

```bash
>>> tutor = 'david john bartlett'

>>> title = 'Mr'

>>> job_title = "Senior Tutor"

```

You can see what _methods_ are available for strings in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)
but you might find it easier to check out [SpeedSheet](https://speedsheet.io/s/python?q=strings-only#T7xJ). Use string methods to create:

A. A new variable called `shouty_name` with value `DAVID JOHN BARTLETT`

B. A new variable called `low_key_title` with value `mr`

C. A new variable called `low_key_job_title` with value `senior tutor`

D. A new variable called `low_key_full_honours` with value `mr david john bartlett senior tutor`

For getting _parts_ of strings, check out [substrings and slicing](https://speedsheet.io/s/python?q=strings-only#nXRd)

Then try to create:

E: A new variable called `first_name` with value `david`

F: A new variable called `surname` with value `bartlett`

G: A new variable called `middle_name` with value `john`

H: A new variable called `full_honours` with value `Mr David John Bartlett, Senior Tutor`. (Note the comma!)
