## 1. Initialise a new git repo

### Instructions:

1. Create a new folder inside `de-prep-steps` called `git-practice`.
2. Navigate into this directory and run `ls -a`. What do the `.` and `..` refer to?
3. To turn this directory into a git repository, run `git init`.
4. Run `ls -a` again to see the `.git` directory which means your repository has been successfully initialised.
5. Confirm this has worked by running `git status`. It should output the name of the branch you are on with no commits yet and no changes at this point.
